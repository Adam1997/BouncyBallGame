# Scala-Gravity-Simulation
This project was created with others at the Macquarie University Winter Workshop for Computing Students.
The program is a game where the user must pop the bouncing balls on the screen with their mouse.

When they pop all the balloons, or run out of lives, the game will end with a pop-up message.   

The program uses the Processing library within Scala, and features many different functional programming concepts such as:
- functional iterations (mappings)
- lambda expressions and anonomyous functions
- case classes and tuples

To run this program, you must use the "sbt run" command in your command line after navigating to the directory. 
(YOU NEED JAVA, SCALA AND SBT INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM)
